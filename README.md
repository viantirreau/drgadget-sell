# DrGadget Chile

DrGadget is a Chilean smartphone trading company. This site was made using Gatsby, inspired from [Gatsby Starter Ecommerce](https://parmsang.github.io/gatsby-starter-ecommerce/) by Parminder Sanghera.

It is a static site that features all the used (and maybe damaged) products that DrGadget buys,
with model selection and an extensive list of failures the device may have. It reports the final
buying price, repair price and market price (when it is in an excellent condition) to let the customer
choose the best alternative.

A live version of the site is available [here](https://retoma.drgadgetchile.cl/).
